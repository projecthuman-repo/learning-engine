- Click on the endpoint you want to test
- Click on the Try it out button
- Enter the required parameters or leave them to use the default parameters
- Click Execute
- The response will be displayed below

### Using it through API calls
- Send a POST request to /api/auth/gettoken with a body of your username and password (Example login credentials: Username: `test`, Password: `test`)
```json
{
  "password": "test",
  "username": "test"
}
```
- Using the token that was returned by the last POST request we can create a header file to authorize us for all future calls
```json

## Deployment and Github Workflow
In the course of our development, we have successfully prioritized a streamlined deployment and GitHub workflow, ensuring efficiency and reliability. GitHub's robust features have been instrumental in our approach, where we effectively utilize issues to track and manage tasks, fostering transparency and organization within our development process. The implementation of branches and pull requests has significantly enhanced collaboration, providing a structured environment for code review and discussion, leading to a seamless integration of new features.

Furthermore, GitHub Actions has played a pivotal role in our workflow, automating testing procedures to ensure the reliability and stability of our codebase. The use of automated deployment processes orchestrated by GitHub Actions has contributed to maintaining a consistent and error-resistant release cycle. This integrated approach, covering issues, pull requests, branches, and GitHub Actions, has not only accelerated our development speed but also upheld a high standard of code quality, resulting in more efficient and reliable software delivery. Our commitment to refining and optimizing this workflow remains steadfast, ensuring continuous improvement in our development practices.

### Auto-Deployment Setup

To setup the auto-deployment on forks, a few environment variables need to be set up in the GitHub repository to allow the GitHub workflow to deploy the application to the virtual machine. The following environment variables need to be set up:
- `REMOTE_HOST`: The IP address of the VM.
- `REMOTE_PORT`: The port number of the VM.
- `REMOTE_USER`: The username of the VM.
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the VM.

### Further Testing

Our workflow is set up to run tests using the pytest framework automatically whenever there's an update to the code as mentioned previously. If you would like to add more test cases, they can be added to the `tests` folder following the pytest framework. You can either create a new file or edit existing ones to include new test scenarios. We've already have test cases for the Language Model (LLM), authentication, database, and games API. The GitHub script is configured to facilitate automatic deployment and testing and mandates no further modifications.

## Coding Standards and Guidelines
In our development workflow, we will continue to prioritize the implementation and adherence to rigorous coding standards and guidelines. These standards serve as a foundational framework, promoting consistency, readability, and maintainability throughout our codebase. By establishing best practices and conventions, we will ensure not only the functionality of our software but also streamline the code review process, facilitating efficient collaboration among team members. This ongoing commitment to coding standards will enhance the overall quality of our code, fostering a shared understanding that enables seamless collaboration, maintenance, and scalability of our project.

## Licenses
This software operates on a closed-source (proprietary) model, a strategic decision initiated by the company's founder to prevent its utilization by competitors. While this approach offers advantages such as safeguarding intellectual property, it introduces challenges such as limited 3rd party integrations and reliance on the owner for maintenance. Additionally, the closed-source nature restricts public contributions to the source code, which, although ensuring control, eliminates the collaborative potential that open-source development often provides for accelerated innovation.
