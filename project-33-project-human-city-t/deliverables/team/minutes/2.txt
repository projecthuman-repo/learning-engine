24th Septemeber (in person) : The team met for the first time with the purpose of bonding and briefly discussing the project. We made sure everyone had the required software (as provided by our partner) installed on our devices and started working on deliverable 1. We then went out to get bubble tea as part of our team bonding excercise.
